# The purpose of Encapsulation

>Encapsulation is used to protect the data from the user.

# Problems with underscore and closures

>It can cause breaking changes and since it is something the user doesnt call directly it often times is overlooked as the issue. Leaked implementation details, expanded attack surface for hackers, and self documenting code.

# Creating a private variable in an ES6 class

>create the class and then make a const that is a new instance of the class
