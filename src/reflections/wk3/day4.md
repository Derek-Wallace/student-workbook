# What problems the Observer pattern resloves

>The Observer pattern watches and updates data as needed in response to certain events.

# The three mechanisms of the observer

>The three mechanisms are the subscribe method, unsubscribe method, the bordcast method.

# The magic of the BCW template

> The bcw template uses the proxy to check data being set or get to make sure it fits and the observer updates things as the proxy passes them.
