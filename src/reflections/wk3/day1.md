# Why do we use exports

>We use exports to help keep our files at a resonable size and our projects organized.

# Export vs Export default

>export default allows you to set the name when you import it to anything while export can only be imported by the proper name.

# The benefit of using modules

>modules allow the use of classes to set up a template for your objects. They are reusable code.
