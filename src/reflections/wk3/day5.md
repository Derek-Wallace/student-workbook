# Reflections of the week

>This week has started to challenge me. I have noticed my coding speed has decreased has I try and think of where things need to be and making sure they are linked properly. The amount of terminology has increased as well which gets harder to keep straight in my head and to remember what each one means. Still feeling good and confident that I can do it.
