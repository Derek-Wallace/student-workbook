# Course Review

> I have very much enjoyed this course and it has really helped me find confidence and skill in something that I enjoy and can see myself doing for my career. I enjoyed the environment that codeworks builds and the structure of the program. I felt like I could focus more on learning the code rather than arbitrary assignments.
