# Purpose of Await and Async

>Await and Async tells the computer to stop and wait until the information from the other computer has returned either ok or rejected.

# What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

>Preface the function with async and use the await keyword before using PUT/POST/GET/DELETE

# Benefits of async/await

>Async/await allows us to check to make sure we are receiving the data that our code is expecting us to receive. The code is simpler to read and easier debugging.
