# What is REST and what does it stand for.

> REST stands for Representational State Transfer, this means when you call to get information from an API the server transfers a representation of the information, meaning it comes back in a certain format like JSON XML or HTML.

# What does stateless mean?

> Stateless means the server doesnt remember anything about the user that uses the API.

# The URL patterns for writing a RESTful API

> The best pattern is using the HTTP methods to handle the requests
