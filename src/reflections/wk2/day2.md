# Three ways to write a function

>The first way is a function declaration. this is used to give a function a definition and then be able to call the function. the second is a function expression. function expressions can be assigned to variables and cannot be run before they are defined. The third is an Arrow Function Expression. Arrow functions do not create their own value.

# Parameters and Arguments

>Parameters are written into the function to determine how it runs. Arguments are the values ran through the function.

# Higher-order functions

> A higher-order function is when a function accepts another function as a parameter or returns a fucntion. some examples being Array.find and Array.prototype.filter
