# The purpose of wire-framing

>Wire framing is used to plan out the layout of a page and some base functionality. It is helpful to give direction to the project.

# The three levels of wire-framing

>The three levels of wire framing are low fidelity mid fidelity and high fidelity. as you step up through the levels you get more and more detailed in the layout and content of the page. Each level has its on use and which one used depends on how muc time energy and effort you want to put into it.

# Are wire-frames worth your T.E.E.?

>Yes, creating a wire-frame is very much worth your T.E.E. by creating a wire-frame in the beginning you save yourself lots of T.E.E. during the creation of the project because it is already presented for you and helps give a very clear path when creating the structure and writing the code.
