# What is a List in C#?

>A list is a collection of like data. For example List int would be a list of integers.

# What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

>list.add because we will often add things to lists. list.contains because we will search through lists often. List.find to search for one thing in particular. List.remove to take things out of a list.

# How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

>list.find to find a particular itme in the list.
