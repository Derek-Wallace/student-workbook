# What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

>Value Type, Reference Type, Pointer Type. Value type stores data in its own memory space. Reference Type doesnt store its value directly, it stores where you can find the value. Pointer Type seta an unmanaged type to one or more identifiers.

# What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

>bool, enum, short, byte, float, struct, char, int, uint, decimal, long, ulong, double, sbyte, ushort. There are a lot more data types that can be more descriptive as well as the data type doesnt change.

# In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

>The value gets put in the database with a reference number so that the value can be accessed through what the reference is.
